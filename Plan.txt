Here is what we have to solve.

Driving Log 
- Record trips (start/end odometer, purpose)
- Fuel purchases (gallons, price, odo)
- Reminders (service maintenance)

---------------------------------------------------------

What we must use.
- Arrays
  ~ At least one Array

- At least two User Defined Function
    - One function takes 1 argument
    - One function returns (and is used) 1 value

- Accepts and validates user input

- Displays formatted and meaningful output

- Uses a menu system, 3 options, must use char
  selector (A, B, C)

- Have a "Summary" option of a compilation of 
  all your code

- Use content we have only covered
  ~ You can use 1 - 2 things, but explain and justify

- Use best practices for
  ~ Users (User friendly and valuable)
  ~ Peers (Coding best practices)
